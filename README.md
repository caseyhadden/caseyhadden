### Summary

I'm a synthesizer. This involves gathering information from a
variety of sources and assessing it given a particular current context. Once
complete, we can define and communicate a desired end state as well as a set of
concrete steps to achieve it. Finally, we can set off implementing this plan
with an expectation to refine it incrementally as we continually learn more
about our context and choices.

### Work

In my career, I've developed parts of products accessed directly by end users,
core libraries and services used by other developers to create their products,
and layers including continuous integration, delivery, and networking
infrastructure.

I'm currently working as a Senior Manager of Software Development at Appian. Our
team provides the infrastructure, libraries, and services used by a 500+ person 
engineering department to run the continuous integration portion of its SDLC.
