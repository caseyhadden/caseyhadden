### Summary

I'm a synthesizer. This involves gathering information from a
variety of sources and assessing it given a particular current context. Once
complete, we can define and communicate a desired end state as well as a set of
concrete steps to achieve it. Finally, we can set off implementing this plan
with an expectation to refine it incrementally as we continually learn more
about our context and choices.

### Current work

I'm currently working with Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes to develop parts of
the core analytics platform at SAS Institute, Inc.
